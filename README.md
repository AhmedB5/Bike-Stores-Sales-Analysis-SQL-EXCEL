Bike Stores Sales Analysis: Analyzing sales data from BikeStores using SQL Server and Excel to extract insights on revenue, customers, and product performance
This project analyzes Bike Stores sales data using SQL Server and Microsoft Excel. The data was extracted from the BikeStores database, which contains information on sales, customers, products, categories, and stores. In SQL Server, JOIN was used to connect different tables such as orders, customers, products, and stores. Additionally, GROUP BY was applied to aggregate data and calculate total revenue and quantities sold per order.

Project Files:
SQL File: Contains database creation scripts, table structures, data insertion, and queries used for analysis.
Excel File: Includes data analysis using Pivot Tables and Measures to generate reports and visualizations.

The data was imported into Power Query for transformation and preprocessing, then analyzed using Power Pivot with Pivot Tables based on the following factors:

Total Revenue Per State: Total revenue per state.
Revenue Per Store: Total revenue per store.
Revenue Per Category: Total revenue per category.
Analysis Tools:
